# üìö Data Structures Word Search Project

This project implements and compares the performance of various **data structures** for word search operations on a large text file (`gutenberg.txt`, ~10,000 words).

The implementation is done **without the use of external libraries**, except for the C++ `<algorithm>` library, used **only** for converting lowercase to uppercase characters.

---

## üß† Implemented Data Structures

1. **Unsorted Array** (`UnSorted`)
2. **Sorted Array** (`Sorted`)
3. **Hash Table** (`HashTable`)
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)`**
5. **Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL Tree)`**

---

## üß™ Description

- The program reads and cleans each word from the file.
- It inserts all words into each structure using their respective `insert` methods.
- Then, a query array `Q` of 10,000 words is formed (sampled uniformly).
- Each word in `Q` is searched in each structure using its own `search` method.
- Total search time for each structure is recorded and printed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- All implementations are custom-built in C++.
- The project uses `algorithm` **only for uppercase transformation**, not for sorting or search.
- No external libraries or STL containers like `map`, `set`, etc. are used.
- All classes include explanatory comments within the source code.

| `main.cpp`        | Main program logic                               |
| `UnSorted.h/cpp`  | Unsorted array structure                         |
